# Python

The programming language we are learning is called Python, created by a developer named Guido van Rossum in the early 90s.

Python is designed to be easy for us to read, which makes it the perfect coding language for beginners.

It's also super versatile and used in the following:

Data analysis & visualization <br>
Artificial intelligence (AI) <br>
Machine learning (ML) <br>
Web development <br>
And more! <br>

All the code we write in this course will be in Python files, with the .py extension.
